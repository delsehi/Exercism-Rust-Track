# Solutions to the Exercism.io Rust Track

[Exercism](https://exercism.io) is a website with challenges for various programming languages. 

They provide you with an explanation, stubs and unit tests. 

These directories contain my solutions to the exercises. 

Generally, I'm the author of anything in the src-folders. 

There's a README in each directory explaining the challenge.
